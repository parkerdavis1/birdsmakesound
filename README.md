# [Birds Make Sound Blog](https://birdsmakesound.com/)

My own writing about birds, sound, recording, and coding. It doubles as a showcase for creative uses of the web platform for story telling and presenting media.

A good example post is: [Life Bird #500](https://birdsmakesound.com/blog/life-bird-500/).

This was originally on Blogger, but I never felt satisfied with the available themes so I recreated it “from scratch” using HTML and CSS and Eleventy static site generator. Posts are written in Markdown. All images are automatically resized and optimized for viewing on different screensizes using Eleventy-img and custom-written eleventy shortcodes.

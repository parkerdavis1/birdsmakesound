On November 4th, 2022, I, Parker Davis, saw my üéâ <span class="celebratory-text">500th life bird</span> üéâ.

Well, sort of. My eBird life list currently shows 503 species (due to some temporary ["Domestic type" taxa Life List inflation](https://ebird.org/news/2022-taxonomy-update)), but if you asked an [American Birding Association Recording Rules and Interpretations](https://www.aba.org/aba-recording-rules-and-interpretations/) purist, they‚Äôd tell you I‚Äôm somewhere around 496. According to me though, I just saw my 500th life bird.

On Thursday, [Tommy DeBardeleben](https://www.birderfrommaricopa.com/) posted in the AZ Rare Bird group chat that he had found a Kentucky Warbler at the Jewel of the Creek Preserve. It had been a stormy day with brief downpours and even hail coming and going throughout the morning and afternoon.  It is the kind of weather that those windows of relative calm, with the dramatic clouds and cool temperatures, make being inside intolerable. A sunset bird chase rarely results in actually seeing the bird, but Nell and I had never been to the Jewel of the Creek preserve and, did I mention the weather was great?, so we decided, hell, let‚Äôs go!

Jewel of the Creek is a well-named section of Cave Creek, with spectacular views of great Cottonwoods surrounded by lush Sonoran desert. When you chase rare birds, you get to know the people who chase them. We were treated to the company of the usual suspects, if only briefly, before we wandered off on our own, exploring the preserve at sunset, taking in the views and the fresh air. We would have preferred to see the Kentucky Warbler, but as we drove home in the dark, there were no regrets.

The next morning, we decided, we aught to try again. The scenery was still spectacular, the weather splendid, our minds caffeinated. We arrived late in the morning but ran into Dara, who told us that much of the birding group from last night had already been there and had the bird generally in the same area as it was first found. As we walked up the trail we heard a loud down-slurred call in the distance that sounded an awful lot like a Kentucky Warbler. Once we got to the spot, we stood still, looking and listening intently. Eventually we caught a glimpse of a yellow and olive bird foraging in the undergrowth.  

We stood in the shade of the Cottonwoods and willows, watching this bird work its way through the area, who was not particularly concerned with us. We were treated to great looks as it foraged in and out of view. It would sometimes give an outburst of calls.

Afterwards, we explored the area, hiking the trails. No matter what number you assign to it, a life bird is always worth celebrating, so we stopped to eat a celebratory chicken parmesan sandwich on the patio of the Cave Creek Oregano‚Äôs.

But why all the ambiguity about numbers? Turns out, not everyone agrees on what birds in what locations are ‚Äúcountable‚Äù. If you see a Rosy-faced Lovebird in Phoenix, it is, according to the ABA, countable (as it should be). They are breeding in Phoenix and have been for more than 15 years. There are thousands of them all around the greater Phoenix metro area, and they all are descended from escaped pets. People are starting to see them in Tucson as well. According to the ABA, those don‚Äôt count, only in Phoenix.

There are also flocks of Yellow-collared Lovebirds, Monk Parakeets, and Nanday Parakeets that live ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù in various places around Phoenix. I, personally, count these birds. The ABA does not. They have not yet met the 15-year threshold for becoming ‚Äúestablished‚Äù.

I have seen a Cockatiel at Granada Park in Phoenix, does that count? In this case, the ABA and I agree, that bird does not count. Judging from its behavior, it was a freshly released pet, looking a bit lost, that unfortunately was probably not going to survive for very long. I just happened to see it at Granada Park, possibly hours after it was released or escaped from its home.

My eBird list also currently includes Graylag Goose and Muscovy Duck. These are commonly domesticated birds, that while I have seen them in the wild, they are visually and genetically pretty different than their ‚Äúwild‚Äù brethren.  eBird is currently changing the way they handle introduced species and domestic variants of species and are working through this thorny issue in their database so everyone‚Äôs eBird life list is a bit inflated at the moment.

But what about House Sparrows, Eurasian Collared-doves, European Starlings? It would feel ridiculous to not count these prevalent, established birds. Whether they were introduced to the Americas by people or not, they are very much wild birds.

I was sitting at 498 for several months but the AOS, the governing body on standardizing bird common names and species status, recently elevated the Lillian‚Äôs subspecies of Eastern Meadowlark to full species, now Chihuahuan Meadowlark (love it).

Birds are moving around on their own and changing and evolving, people are moving birds around, selectively breeding and domesticating them, species and the concepts that underpin them are in flux.

All of which is to say, these numbers are not immutable truths. So why am I even making the bold claim that this bird is #500? Why number them at all? Why celebrate such a thing?

Life lists do not indicate how observant a birder is. How skilled or knowledgable they are. Life lists do not make one a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúworse‚Äù birder.

I sometimes do find it fun to engage in the ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù mode of birding, year lists, county lists, eBird Top 100 etc but no one would

In this case, deciding that this bird is #500 is more a way of recognizing and celebrating all of the experiences I‚Äôve had in pursuit of birds. Milestones are always a bit arbitrary, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there is no value in recognizing and celebrating them.
